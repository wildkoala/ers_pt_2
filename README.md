Electric Boogalo


Imagine the old version of Eqyptian Rat Screw I made, just better.

Things I want to hit on here that I didn't do last time:
1. structs that make sense - *FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, JUST MAKE A LINKED LIST*
2. networking - I got scared or bored or something and didn't put it in the last one
3. async??????? - I need the "slap" functionality for this to really be ERS. I think I'll have to sell my soul to the devil to get this working properly over the network, but we're gonna give it a shot
4. Multi-threading??????? - I've done this before to have multiple games running for the catan terminal game in python, but that was python, come on.

If SOMEHOW this all comes together, can I get a virtual round of applause from you? I know I want be able to hear it- just do it for me anyway, okay?
